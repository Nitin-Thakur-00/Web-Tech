        <P>Ed and Lorraine Warren were renowned paranormal investigators who dedicated their lives to helping people
            deal with supernatural phenomena.</P>
        <Section>
            <p>Edward Warren Miney (September 7, 1926 – August 23, 2006) and Lorraine Rita Warren (née Moran; January
                31, 1927 – April 18, 2019) were American paranormal investigators and authors associated with prominent
                cases of alleged hauntings. Edward was a self-taught and self-professed demonologist, author, lecturer
                and artist. Lorraine professed to be clairvoyant and a light trance medium who worked closely with her
                husband.

                In 1952, the Warrens founded the New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR), the oldest
                ghost-hunting group in New England. They authored many books about the paranormal and about their
                private investigations into various reports of paranormal activity. They claimed to have investigated
                well over 10,000 cases during their career.The Warrens were among the first investigators in the
                Amityville haunting. According to the Warrens, the official website of the NESPR, Viviglam Magazine, and
                several other sources, the NESPR uses a variety of individuals, including medical doctors, researchers,
                police officers, nurses, college students, and members of the clergy in its investigations.

                Stories of ghost hauntings popularized by the Warrens have been adapted as or indirectly inspired dozens
                of films, television series, and documentaries, including several films in the Amityville Horror series
                and the films in The Conjuring Universe.

                Skeptics Perry DeAngelis and Steven Novella investigated the Warrens' evidence and called it
                "blarney". Skeptical investigators Joe Nickell and Benjamin Radford concluded that the better-known
                hauntings, Amityville and the Snedeker family haunting (dramatized in the film The Haunting in
                Connecticut), did not happen and had been invented.
